              <p class="letter-greeting">Dear Tuku Puku,</p>
              <p class="letter-body">
                I just want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, how much I
                love you and how proud I am of you ❤️. You carry so much on your
                shoulders, and yet you still find ways to care, to love, and to
                keep going. I see all of it the tiredness, the worries, the
                little struggles that no one else notices and I want you to know
                that none of it goes unseen. You don’t have to be strong all the
                time, baby. It’s okay to feel tired, anxious, or even invisible
                sometimes. You are allowed to rest, to take breaks, to just be,
                without worrying about anything or anyone. And whenever those
                moments come, I’ll be right here with you, quietly loving you,
                holding you up, and letting you lean on me. You don’t have to
                carry anything alone 🫶. The road may get bumpy, and life can
                feel heavy, but I want you to remember this: you are never
                alone. I’ll walk every step of that road with you, help you back
                up whenever you feel like you’re about to fall, and be your safe
                place when everything feels overwhelming ❤️. Sometimes people
                may not see how incredible you are, and that can hurt deeply.
                But my dear Baby, that’s not a reflection of your worth, because
                in reality you are way more amazing, loved, and important, and I
                hope you always remember that even on the days it feels like no
                one else notices. Looking back at these past two years with you,
                I am overwhelmed by how much we’ve built together. From the
                simple comfort of the food we share like the taste of the
                chicken you made for me and the pasta I made for you to the way
                we've explored the world side-by-side ❤️. I still hold the
                memories of our adventures in Jigmechu so close to my heart, and
                those quiet, long walks we used to take in Gelephu mean more to
                me than words can say. Even when we were apart, you were always
                right there with me. I treasure every late-night text and those
                endless calls that lasted until we both drifted off to sleep. I
                think about the weekends we spent traveling to visit each other
                at college, counting down the hours just to see your face. We’ve
                exchanged so many gifts over these two years, each one a little
                piece of our story. But for this Valentine’s Day, I wanted to do
                something a little different ❤️. I wanted to use my skills to
                build something just for you ssa space that is yours and yours
                alone. That’s why I decided to build this website and embed this
                letter here, so you always have a place to come back to when you
                need to be reminded of how much you mean to me. Please don’t
                feel pressured to reply to this or even think about it right
                now. Just let yourself rest, breathe, and heal ❤️. I’ll be right
                here, patiently and quietly, loving you through it all. Your
                happiness, your comfort, and your peace mean the world to me.
                Thank you for being you, for all the moments we’ve shared, and
                for letting me love you. You are my heart, my baby, my
                everything. I’ll always be here for you, no matter what. So,
                with all that we’ve been through and all that is yet to come...
                will you be my Valentine? 🌹
